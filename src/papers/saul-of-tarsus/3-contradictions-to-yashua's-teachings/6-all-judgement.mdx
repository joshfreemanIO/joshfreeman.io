<Verse book="John" verse="5:22-23" version="KJV">
For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son: That all men should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father. He that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father which hath sent him.
</Verse>

<Verse book="1 Corinthians" verse="5:3" version="KJV">
For I verily, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have judged already, as though I were present, concerning him that hath so done this deed,
</Verse>

<Verse book="1 Corinthians" verse="5:13" version="NKJV">
For what have I to do with judging those also who are outside? Do you not judge those who are inside? But those who are outside God judges. Therefore “put away from yourselves the evil person.”
</Verse>
