Starting this week, I separate for Grok Interactive.

I struggled with this decision for a long time. The needs I have today are not the needs I had when I arrived. One of the needs that has become loudest is to embrace the fog of life and seek adventure.

When I landed on Jason's doorstep, I was lost in the sea of tech, weighed far more than I should, and badly needed a razor. Grok became a home with friends that endure life together and gave me the space to transform my life into something better than where I was headed. Finding Grok was a gift from God, and I'm thankful for the time I was given.

My next step is to take time with my family in December. When I'm free, I'll be building an event sourcing library in Elixir and writing about it here. I believe it's possible to get a fully reactive system based upon events. If correct, it will enable senior-level productivy at a junior-level effort on globally-scalable and fault-tolerant system.

This system is the technical foundation for the rest of my life. Perhaps even ours.

I'm excited for the future. You should be to.

Grok On.
