Firstly, you will need [download and install Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/), your IDE (integrated development environment) for writing your software, building your games, and testing in iOS simulators.

Next, read through this [Xcode tutorial](https://codewithchris.com/xcode-tutorial/) and follow along. It gives a great overview of the different parts of Xcode and will familiarize you with the primary flow of app development.

Now that you're more comfortable with Xcode, run through this [SpriteKit Tutorial](https://www.raywenderlich.com/71-spritekit-tutorial-for-beginners). It will teach you the basics of sprite-based game development with Swift.

When you feel ready to level up, use the online [Swift Book](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/) and documentation for [Sprite Kit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/spritekit). In general, API references and documentation are the primary resource for developers to learn more deeply about their tools from the creators. There are loads of more tutorials on Google and YouTube
