description: >
  VoteEasy is a comparison tool to provide free, factual, unbiased information on candidates and elected officials for United States elections.
summary: >
  During VoteEasy, I designed the mechanism for translating a user's political preference on a wide range of issues and convert that to a relative distance of the political candidate's lawn sign. Signs appearing closer to you would indicate the likelihood that a candidate's views matched your own.

achievements:
  - Animated the repositioning of lawn signs as a user indicates their political views
  - Designed the sizing algorithm for relative similarity within the candidate fiel
