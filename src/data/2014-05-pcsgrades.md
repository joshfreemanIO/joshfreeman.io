description: >
  PCSgrades is service for US Military members and their families to rate and review neighborhoods, base housing, REALTORS®, mortgage lenders, schools and other related services.

summary: >
  I focused mostly on the front-end – the look and feel – of this app while I learned Ruby. I designed a UI component system that enabled rapid development of consistently styled elements to keep pace with the rapid requirement changes. Towards the end of my time with the project, I was the lead programmer and responsible for project's architecture.

achievements:
  - Highlighted the reviewed services near specified PCS locations on an interactive maps
  - Developed the backend Rails architecture to support the service
  - Designed and implemented the UI component model for displaying variable data
